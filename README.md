In this project(Object Detection)- first locating the object and then identify object classes like Person,Dog,Cat,etc.
## YoloV3 Algorithm
* You Only Look Once also known as YOLO is one of the fastest real-time object detection algorithm and it applies a neural network to the entire image to predict bounding boxes and their probabilities.
* using pre-trained model of yolov3 that is trained with coco.dataset which has different object classes and cfg files
* Now we ready to detect objects from the input forms like images, webcam feed and videos using Opencv library.
* And results are shown in an image with object classes and predicted bounding boxes of an object.
